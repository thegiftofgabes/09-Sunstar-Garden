<h1 id="a-hermit-tends-to-a-garden-under-the-silvery-light-of-a-lone-sunstar">A hermit tends to a garden under the silvery light of a lone Sunstar</h1>
<p>There is a garden in this place in-between worlds. A hermit tends to this garden, growing flowers that sing, trees that make no shade, and fruits that feed you your own happy memories.</p>
<p>A mote of light that is too far to be a sun and too close to be a star is neither and both. It sheds its silvery, preternatural light upon the garden and that is soft and shadowless.</p>
<p>The hermit needs something. They also hold a secret. Which will they reveal and which will you have to find out to get out of this displaced place.</p>

<li>The Hermit finds you and offers to tell you a secret or to accept helping them. Both are unpleasant and neither is escapable.</li>
